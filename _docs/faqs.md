### What is this? 

The tool you're using is called Dr. Fill. It's AiCRE's solution to tenant selection. It looks at information about your property, its tenants, the surrounding trade area, and more and recommends the tenant types that will be the most useful in your property's vacancies.


### How are recommendations made?

Dr. Fill makes tenant type recommendations that are predicted to be the most useful across different objectives held by different stakeholders: Retailers, Leasing Agents, and Retail CRE Management. 

The usefulness of a recommendation is measured by what we call **The Score**. **The Score** is designed to coordinate, balance, optimize, and simplify the many different objectives different stakeholders have into a single easy-to-understand number, without skewing the importance of any single objective. The objectives and how we measure them are:

| Objective                                   | How it’s measured                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|---------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Minimize tenant turnover                    | Cumulative annual risk of all the tenants at the property defecting at any given point. We estimate this using historical data on tenant turnover.                                                                                                                                                |
| Minimize competition at the property        | 1 / (competition level x competition quality)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Maximize complementarity of tenant mix      |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Maximize diversity at the property          | k = number of tenant types at property p.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Maximize rents                              | How sensitive tenant types are to rent hikes. This is measured by the elasticity of demand given the property, tenant, and trade area. By collecting data on tenant types across a variety of circumstances like geography, urban density, trade are types, etc., we can figure out what characteristics certain tenant types are willing to pay more for. |
| Maximize consumer draw                      | Average foot traffic volume to property. Placer.ai data                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Maximize consumer visit duration            | Average time spent per visit to property. Placer.ai data                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Minimize Tenant Improvement Allowance (TIA) | We estimate how much TI it would take to convert a space from current to target tenant type, given what we know about common industry requirements for the space infrastructure, utility composition, etc.                                                                                      |

Each objective is optimized using data from four sources: 
1. **the property profile**
2. the property’s existing **tenant-mix profile**
3. trade area **demographics**
4. trade area **competition**. 

Each of these sources is broken down even further so we can measure, weight, and balance specific priorities in tenant selection, depending on which objective we’re optimizing. 


#### Property Profiles 
consist of the U.S. state, GLA of the property, and GLA of the vacant space(s). 
* Property Tenant Mix Profiles: we created a single metric, called the Tenant Mix Index (TMI), that combines two things that both leasing agents and prospective retailers care about: how competitive the property is and how diverse the property is. The TMI reflects a balance between these, and has the ability to emphasize one over the other through weighting. A higher score indicates that the property is strong in both aspects, or exceptionally strong in one if heavily weighted. 1 is the maximum TMI, 0 is the minimum. Diversity and competitiveness default to equal weighting when calculating TMI for a property. But if customers prefer, Dr. Fill can reverse engineer if your tenant mix strategy values diversity or competitiveness more and adapt recommendations accordingly. Let’s break down how we quantify diversity and competitiveness.
    * **Competitiveness.** This measures how complementary or competitive the existing co-tenants are. We call this Property Competitiveness.
    * Property Competitiveness ranges from -1 to 1, where -1 is the least competitive (the most complimentary), 1 is the most competitive (the least complimentary), and 0 is neutral. Property Competitiveness is the average Tenant-to-tenant competitiveness at the property after all the tenant types were compared with one another, weighted by each tenant type's GLA. 
    * Tenant types are considered more competitive with each other when price increases of one make people buy more of the other. People buy more jelly when the price of jam goes up, for example. Tenant types are considered more complimentary with each other when price increases of one make people buy less of the other. People buy less peanut butter when the price of jelly goes up, for example.
    * **Diversity.** How diverse the set of existing co-tenants is. We call this **Property Diversity.**
    * **Property Diversity** ranges from 0 to 1. 0 is the least diverse, meaning every tenant type is the same. 1 is the most diverse, meaning every tenant type is different. Technically, it's a metric based on Shannon's Diversity Index. In the context of Dr. Fill, Property Diversity quantifies how hard it is to predict a tenant’s type based solely on the vacant space’s share of the property GLA. 
    * There are two important advantages in quantifying Property Diversity this way: 
        1. It's nuanced. It considers both the presence and proportion of different tenant types in terms of the property’s overall GLA.
        2. It assumes that a more even distribution of GLA across tenant types indicates greater diversity. 

#### Trade Area Competition
Trade Area Competition is measured in terms of the level of competition and the quality of that competition. 
* *Level of Competition.* How many businesses of the same tenant type are within the trade area.
* *Quality of Competition.* The average 5 star Google Review of those businesses.

#### Trade Area Demographics
Average household income, education levels, and home values in the trade area. 

Recommendations prioritize these four sources because they drive outcomes that many Retail CRE stakeholders care about. 
Retailers care about finding a location that helps their business thrive.
Leasing agents care about making retailers happy, reducing time off market, and fulfilling corporate tenant mix strategy. 
Commercial Real Estate management cares about financial stability, minimizing tenant turnover, maximizing consumer draw and visit duration, and maximizing overall property desirability. 

### How do you know the recommendations are good? 

Our first priority is making *useful* recommendations. And we can’t do that if they’re not good. We evaluate the goodness of recommendations by looking at many different metrics across many different geographies, property profiles, and trade areas, to figure out when recommendations are good. In fact, we have no single definition or dimension of ‘goodness’. Our many evaluation metrics and what they are are:

| Evaluation Metric | What it is & why it matters                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | How It’s Measured                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| Utility           | The expected value in KPI’s like dollars that REITs get from the recommendation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | The cumulative reward functions for each objective above. Each objective has its own cumulative reward. The sum of all the rewards is the total utility of a recommendation.

| Risk              | How variable utility is.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | In some cases a recommendation may be associated with a potential risk. For example, some users may wish to be risk-averse, preferring tenants with lower rent willingness, but also a lower risk of turnover. We measure this as the variance of the utility metric.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

We train a model on all the data we have on properties, mask the actual correct tenant type, then ask the model to see if it can predict the masked tenant type. How far down the list of its recommendations the correct tenant type falls tells us how accurate it is. If the masked tenant is recommended first, the model is maximally accurate. If the actual tenant type is 10th in a top 10 list, it’s not accurate. |
| Coverage          | How much of the Retail CRE landscape it works for. This is measured for customers and properties.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Customer space coverage: not all REITs are created equal. While our model is training on new properties all the time, we have more data on some kinds than others. The more data we have, the better the “coverage” the model has for customers and properties with certain characteristics. Coverage here can be measured by the richness of the customer or property profile required to make a reliable recommendation. For example, maybe we learned that the model requires examples of 100 tenant types before it can make a good recommendation. |
| Confidence        | How much the machine learning models trust their own recommendations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | The most common measurement of confidence is the probability that the predicted value is indeed true, or the interval around the predicted value where a predefined portion (e.g. 95%) of the true values lie.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| Novelty           | Novel recommendations are recommendations for tenants that the user did not know about or wouldn’t have chosen themselves (but are nevertheless useful)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Popular tenant types are less likely to be novel. So novelty can be taken into account by using an accuracy metric where the system does not get the same credit for correctly predicting popular tenants as it does when it correctly predicts unpopular tenants.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

E.g., if the user has no history of managing a tenant type at a property like the one it’s being recommended for.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

### How does the AI work?

Dr. Fill is a special breed of AI known as a [Deep Reinforcement Learning Agent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_reinforcement_learning). This is just a fancy way of saying that it learns the best thing to do through trial and error. Dr. Fills actions are its recommendations, its rewards are the expected utility of optimizing the above objective functions, and its environment is the combination of the property profile, trade area, and other defining physical details in the real world.

### Where did the tenant type categories come from? 
We use 40+ tenant type descriptions from ULI Descriptions as the base and harmonize that with the tenant type information a customer has on file. We harmonize a customer’s tenant type data into the 40+ categories based on how semantically similar the tenant names and tenant category names are. E.g., Fast Casual - Asian and Asian Style Restaurant are both very similar semantically so belong in the same Tenant Type.

### How do I use this info? 
Anyway you’d like! We recommend using it to learn about specific drivers of your property’s dynamics and in conversations with prospective tenants to help close deals.
